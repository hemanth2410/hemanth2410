Hi there, my name is Sai Hemanth Sattenapalli. I am a programmer and game developer with a passion for cutting-edge technology. Over the years, I have developed a diverse set of skills, including expertise in robotics, python, and autonomous vehicle technology. I believe that technology has the power to change the world for the better, and I am dedicated to using my skills to make a positive impact in society.

My work in game development has taught me the importance of creativity, collaboration, and perseverance. As a programmer, I strive to create code that is efficient, elegant, and user-friendly. I believe that good programming is not just about writing code, but also about problem-solving and communication.

My interest in robotics and autonomous vehicle technology has led me to explore the cutting edge of automation and machine learning. I am excited about the possibilities of these technologies, and I am eager to continue learning and pushing the boundaries of what is possible.

Overall, I am a driven and curious individual who is passionate about technology and its potential to make the world a better place. I am always seeking new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow, and I look forward to what the future holds.

<h3>Features:</h3>
1. <b>Utilizing Unity's New Addressables</b>: Our technology leverages Unity's powerful Addressables system to efficiently manage and load game assets. This allows for dynamic and optimized loading of assets based on player's location.

2. <b>Dynamic Chunk Loading</b>: We have implemented a robust system that calculates the player's position and intelligently loads chunks of the game map that are within a certain range, typically set to less than 1700 meters in all directions. This ensures that the player experiences a seamless and immersive gameplay environment.

3. <b>Asynchronous Unloading</b>: To maintain optimal performance, we have incorporated asynchronous unloading of unwanted mesh data and other objects. This ensures that only the necessary assets are loaded and active in the game scene, optimizing memory usage and improving overall performance.

4. <b>Non-Blocking Workflow</b>: Our technology ensures that the main thread is not locked during the loading process. We have implemented an async workflow that allows for concurrent loading and processing of assets, preventing any noticeable hitches or delays in the gameplay experience.

We are excited to share our progress and collaborate with the game development community to advance open world streaming technology. Join us on this exciting journey as we work towards creating immersive and expansive virtual worlds.

<h3>Experiments with raymarching</h3>

<b>Ray marching</b>: This sphere is completely mathematical and generated using shader math, not mesh.

<b>Gravitational lensing</b>: i have used the above mentioned concept to create a black hole without accretion disc

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d43fa80e-bfba-406e-bb1f-f2b7575c39e9

<b>Density volume using raymarching</b>: I tried creating accretion disc using mesh and SDF technique but result was fruitless so i switched the things and am currently trying to simulate it as a cloud.

Next i will be combining above techniques to render gargantua from interstellar
